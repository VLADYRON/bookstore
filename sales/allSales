the same honesty humor and originality found in his songs He describes growing up Catholic in Freehold New Jersey amid the poetry danger and darkness that fueled his imagination leading up to the moment he refers to as The Big Bang seeing Elvis Presleys debut on The Ed Sullivan Show He vividly recounts his relentless drive to become a musician his early days as a bar band king in Asbury Park and the rise of the E Street Band With disarming candor he also tells for the first time the story of the personal struggles that inspired his best work and shows us why the song Born to Run reveals more than we previously realized Born to Run will be revelatory for anyone who has ever enjoyed Bruce Springsteen but this book is much more than a legendary rock stars memoir This is a book for workers and dreamers parents and children lovers and loners artists freaks or anyone who has ever wanted to be baptized in the holy river of rock and roll Rarely has a performer told his own story

to write about it Thats how this extraordinary autobiography began Over the past seven years Bruce Springsteen has privately devoted himself to writing the story of his life bringing to these pages the same honesty humor and originality found in his songs He describes growing up Catholic in Freehold New Jersey amid the poetry danger and darkness that fueled his imagination leading up to the moment he refers to as The Big Bang seeing Elvis Presleys debut on The Ed Sullivan Show He vividly recounts his relentless drive to become a musician his early days as a bar band king in Asbury Park and the rise of the E Street Band With disarming candor he also tells for the first time the story of the personal struggles that inspired his best work and shows us why the song Born to Run reveals more than we previously realized Born to Run will be revelatory for anyone who has ever enjoyed Bruce Springsteen but this book is much more than a legendary rock stars memoir This is a book for workers and dreamers parents and children lovers and loners artists freaks or anyone who has ever wanted to be baptized in the holy river of rock and roll Rarely has a performer told his own story

to Run\",\"Author\":\"Bruce Springsteen\",\"Summary\":\"In 2009 Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band performed at the Super Bowls halftime show The experience was so exhilarating that Bruce decided to write about it Thats how this extraordinary autobiography began Over the past seven years Bruce Springsteen has privately devoted himself to writing the story of his life bringing to these pages the same honesty humor and originality found in his songs He describes growing up Catholic in Freehold New Jersey amid the poetry danger and darkness that fueled his imagination leading up to the moment he refers to as The Big Bang seeing Elvis Presleys debut on The Ed Sullivan Show He vividly recounts his relentless drive to become a musician his early days as a bar band king in Asbury Park and the rise of the E Street Band With disarming candor he also tells for the first time the story of the personal struggles that inspired his best work and shows us why the song Born to Run reveals more than we previously realized Born to Run will be revelatory for anyone who has ever enjoyed Bruce Springsteen but this book is much more than a legendary rock stars memoir This is a book for workers and dreamers parents and children lovers and loners artists freaks or anyone who has ever wanted to be baptized in the holy river of rock and roll Rarely has a performer told his own story with such force and sweep Like many of his songs Thunder Road Badlands Darkness on the Edge of Town The River Born in the USA The Rising and The Ghost of Tom Joad to name just a few Bruce Springsteens autobiography is written with the lyricism of a singular songwriter and the wisdom of a man who has thought deeply about his experiences
